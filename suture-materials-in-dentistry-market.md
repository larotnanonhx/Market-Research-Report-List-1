<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Materials in Dentistry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Non-absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the dental market, suture materials are categorized into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable sutures gradually dissolve in the body over time, making them ideal for soft tissue closures where long-term support isnâ€™t necessary. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, remain intact and require removal after healing, providing stable support for more complex procedures. Both types are essential for various dental surgeries, ensuring proper wound healing and minimizing complications. Their selection depends on the surgical procedure and patient needs.</p></p>
